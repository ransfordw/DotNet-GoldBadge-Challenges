# Assignment

Clone the project. There are 8 challenge assemblies each with their own unit test project.

Using Repository Pattern, complete the challenges with passing Unit Test projects.

Your methods should each have a single responsibility.

## Here is the pattern for each challenge:
1. The Challenge_1 assembly is a console app that has a Program.cs file and a .txt file.
2. The .txt file has a coding challenge in it. 
3. Except for Unit Tests, you can add any necessary classes or files in this assembly for this particular challenge.
4. The Challenge_1_Test assembly is where the Unit Tests will go for the corresponding challenge. Youâ€™ll need to rename the UnitTest file accordingly.
5. Repeat this for other challenges.
